# Data-driven tractable attribution modelling

At this project two data-driven and statistically-oriented attribution models of an advertising campaign of a “Fortune 500 Automobile Manufacturer” are developed.

Due to confidential agreement with the client, the analysed dataset is not provided. Therefore, the initial datasets regarding advertising activitites, impressions, clicks and conversions are not present. However, a sample draft of the preprocessed ([`network_impressions_modelling.csv`](https://github.com/AndreasGeorgopoulos/attribution-modelling/blob/master/network_impressions_modelling.csv)) and transformed ([`dataframe_impressions_user_date.csv`](https://github.com/AndreasGeorgopoulos/attribution-modelling/blob/master/dataframe_impressions_user_date.csv)) datasets that was used during the attribution modelling part are provided.
